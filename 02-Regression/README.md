# Regression

Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value, like salary for example. If your independent variable is time, then you are forecasting future values, otherwise your model is predicting present but unknown values. Regression technique vary from Linear Regression to SVR and Random Forests Regression.

In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Regression models:

1. Simple Linear Regression -
    * Dependent Variable = Y-intercept + Slope * Independent Valuable or y=mx+b
    * The ideal is to model the data progression as a linear change. It's very simple
    * Ordinary least squares derives the linear regression by creating the space between the point on the line and the actual known points, SUM(y-i-y-delta)^2
2. Multiple Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Regression
4. Support Vector for Regression (SVR)
5. Decision Tree Regression
6. Random Forest Regression
